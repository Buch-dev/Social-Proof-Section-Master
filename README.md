<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```


### Continued development

gI've discoverd how awesome and powerful it is to work with CSS Transitions property, thus i'll love to work more with CSS Transitions in my upcoming projects so as to strenghten and improve my knowledge on Transition Properties
